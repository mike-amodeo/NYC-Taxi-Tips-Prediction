This repository is an exercise to build a model predicting the tip on NYC taxi fares over three months in 2017. All work was done in Jupyter notebook included in this repo. Files included:

Taxi Fares and Tips 1 EDA - Jupyter notebook with data import, review exploratory data analysis, and data conditioning for model building.

Taxi Fares and Tips 2 Model - Jupyter notebook that imports data from EDA notebook 1, builds a few different models, and evaluates model performance.

Taxi Fares and Tips 3 Summary Text - Jupyter notebook that includes text assembled from the previous two notebooks. Text is mostly consistent with some light editing, but it can be viewed without code or plots.

NYC Taxi Tipping Prediction - Slides.pdf - PDF file of google slides summarizing some of the EDA, model building, and model evaluation process. More detail can be found in the three Jupyter notebooks.
